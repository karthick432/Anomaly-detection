# Anomaly Detection System

Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify rare patterns or behaviors in data that do not conform to expected norms. This project implements an anomaly detection system using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Features
- Detects anomalies in datasets using machine learning algorithms.
- Supports real-time and batch data processing.
- Provides insights and visualization of detected anomalies.
- Uses **Python** and **Streamlit** for the frontend.
- Implements a **hierarchical multimodal fusion** model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/karthick432/Anomaly-detection.git
   cd Anomaly-detection
2. Run
   ```sh
   streamlit run app2.py

📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training is network_dataset_cleaned.csv.

Preprocessing is applied before training the model.

⚡ Model Implementation
The model uses:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image-based anomaly detection.

Attention mechanisms for hierarchical multimodal fusion.
